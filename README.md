# HyperionDev Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp - Level 3 Task 4 - Capstone project - iTunes app

## Description

This task is the Capstone project for level 3 and is an "iTunes app". It fetches a list of media (songs, movies, podcasts and more) using the [iTunes store API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/). The results are displayed on screen. The user can search for their own tracks or media and can specify which media type they want to search for. The user can also create a list of their favourites.
